# /clone-build

Drive the clone-build skill: spec → scaffold → gated task graph → verified code.

## Instructions

Follow the clone-build skill workflow in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-build/SKILL.md` exactly, phases P0 through P5.

### Step 1: Locate the spec
If the user passed a path, use it. Otherwise look for
`./work/<pkg>/clone-build-spec.md`. If none exists, tell the user to run clone-app
Phase 8 first.

### Step 2: Run the skill
Execute P0 → P5. Surface the plan's `gaps` and any `needs-human-input` tasks before
execution. Honor the Error Handling Summary table in SKILL.md.

### Step 3: Deliver
Ensure `./work/<pkg>/build-report-<date>.md` is written and summarize the outcome.
