# Clone App — Feasibility & Effort Analysis

Take a Google Play URL (or package name), reverse engineer the app, analyze its
market, estimate AI-assisted clone effort and infrastructure cost, and produce a
viability report. If the user approves, hand off to the writing-plans skill to
generate a full implementation plan.

This skill orchestrates 8 phases. Deterministic steps are factored into helper
scripts under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/scripts/`. Reverse
engineering reuses the sibling `android-reverse-engineering` plugin's scripts.

## Legal note
Only analyze apps you are authorized to (your own, or for lawful interoperability
/ research). Surface this to the user if intent is unclear. Do not proceed for
clearly infringing intent.
Pixel-perfect cloning and extracting copyrighted assets (especially game art via
AssetRipper) is high-risk. Proceed only for authorized use; the build spec
recreates assets in the same style and treats extracted assets as reference, not
ship-ready, outside authorized contexts.

## Phase 0: Input & Validation

Extract the package name:
```bash
PKG="$(bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/scripts/extract-package.sh "<user-input>")"
```
If it exits non-zero, ask the user for the package name directly, then re-run.

Create the working dir: `WORK="./work/$PKG"` and `mkdir -p "$WORK"`.

## Phase 1: APK Download

```bash
APK="$(bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/scripts/download-apk.sh "$PKG" "$WORK")"
```
The script downloads via `apkeep` (default source `apk-pure`; no auth, no
JavaScript, handles XAPK split bundling) and prints the path (`app.apk` or
`app.xapk`). It needs the `apkeep` binary on PATH — install with
`brew install apkeep` (or `cargo install apkeep`). If it exits non-zero,
`apkeep` may be missing or the app isn't on that source (try another with
`CLONE_APP_APKEEP_SOURCE=apk-combo`) — tell the user the download failed and
ask for a local APK/XAPK path; set `APK` to that path.

## Phase 2: Reverse Engineering (probe → dispatch → consume)

RE runs inside an **isolated subagent** so the decompiled sources never flood
this orchestrator's context. The subagent prefers the
`android-reverse-engineering` **skill** and falls back to that plugin's bash
**scripts**. Either way it writes the same digest files to `$WORK/`, defined
in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/references/re-digest-contract.md`.

### Phase 2a — Probe

```bash
RE="$(bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/scripts/resolve-re-scripts.sh 2>/tmp/re-err)"; RC=$?
```
- `RC == 0` → the RE **scripts** are on disk (fallback is available). If it
  printed a `WARNING:` about bash version, the scripts need **bash 4+**
  (macOS ships 3.2; `${VAR,,}` fails as "bad substitution") — install one with
  `brew install bash` before the script-fallback branch can succeed.
- Check your own available-skills list for `android-reverse-engineering` →
  is the RE **skill** registered?

Pick the branch:

| RE skill registered | RE scripts on disk (`RC`) | Branch |
|---|---|---|
| yes | any | **re-skill** |
| no | 0 | **direct-scripts** |
| no | 1 | **stop** — show the `/tmp/re-err` resolver error and halt |

### Phase 2b — Dispatch the subagent

Dispatch one subagent (Agent tool, `general-purpose` type — it can both invoke
skills and run bash). Pass it: `$PKG`, `$APK`, `$WORK`, the chosen **branch**,
the resolved `$RE` scripts dir, and the path to `re-digest-contract.md`. Its
instructions:

Tell the subagent its clone-app scripts dir is
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/scripts/` (pass it explicitly as `$CA`).

1. **Run RE per branch.**
   - **re-skill:** invoke the android-reverse-engineering skill on `$APK`,
     output dir `$WORK/output` — run its full workflow (fingerprint, deps,
     decompile, Kotlin-name recovery if Kotlin, API extraction incl. Tier-2).
   - **direct-scripts:** run, in order, reading each output before the next:
     `bash "$RE/fingerprint.sh" "$APK"`, `bash "$RE/check-deps.sh"`
     (install required deps via `bash "$RE/install-dep.sh" <dep>`; ask before
     optional vineflower/dex2jar), `bash "$RE/decompile.sh" -o "$WORK/output" "$APK"`
     (add `--deobf` if obfuscation is heavy), `bash "$RE/recover-kotlin-names.sh"
     "$WORK/output/sources" "$WORK/output/names/"` if Kotlin, then
     `bash "$RE/find-api-calls.sh" "$WORK/output/sources"`.
2. **Detect Unity & capture design.** After decompile:
   - `UNITY="$(bash "$CA/detect-unity.sh" "$APK")"` — prints exactly `il2cpp|mono|none`.
   - **Non-Unity (`none`):** run
     `python3 "$CA/extract-design.py" "$WORK/output" --package "$PKG" --out "$WORK/design-tokens.json" --digest "$WORK/design-digest.md"`
     per `design-capture-guide.md`.
   - **Unity (`il2cpp`):** locate `libil2cpp.so` + `global-metadata.dat` under
     `$WORK/output` (or unzip from `$APK`); run
     `bash "$CA/il2cpp-dump.sh" <so> <metadata> "$WORK/unity-out"` and
     `bash "$CA/unity-assets.sh" "$APK" "$WORK/game-assets"`; inventory
     `$WORK/game-assets/` into `$WORK/game-assets/manifest.json` (a JSON list
     of `{"path": ..., "type": ...}` entries for every extracted file); write
     `$WORK/unity-digest.md` (type model + netcode) per `unity-re-guide.md`.
   - **Unity (`mono`):** extract `assets/bin/Data/Managed/*.dll` from `$APK`
     (for an XAPK, from the nested `base.apk`) into `$WORK/managed/`, then
     `ilspycmd "$WORK/managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll" -o "$WORK/unity-out"`
     (repeat for other DLLs of interest; near-source C#), plus
     `bash "$CA/unity-assets.sh" "$APK" "$WORK/game-assets"`; inventory
     `$WORK/game-assets/` into `$WORK/game-assets/manifest.json` (a JSON list
     of `{"path": ..., "type": ...}` entries for every extracted file); write
     `$WORK/unity-digest.md` per `unity-re-guide.md`.
   - If a Unity tool exits 3 (missing), continue with a partial digest and set
     `RE Method: limited: unity-no-tools`.
3. **Framework guard:** if the fingerprint is Flutter / React Native / Cordova
   / Xamarin, Java decompile is shallow — produce a partial digest, set
   `RE Method: limited: <framework>`, payloads may be empty.
4. **Extract** the Tier-1 endpoint inventory and Tier-2 payloads for **auth,
   payment/checkout, and the 1–2 core feature endpoints** (not every endpoint).
5. **Write** `$WORK/re-digest.md`, `$WORK/payloads.json`, `$WORK/re-summary.txt`
   exactly per `re-digest-contract.md`. Also produce `$WORK/design-tokens.json`
   and `$WORK/design-digest.md` (plus `$WORK/unity-digest.md` and
   `$WORK/game-assets/` when Unity).
6. **Return** the contents of `$WORK/re-summary.txt` plus a short `design-summary`
   (and `unity-summary` when Unity) and the digest file paths —
   **never** raw decompiled sources, resources, or assets.

If the subagent fails, retry once; if it still fails and the **direct-scripts**
branch is available (i.e. the Phase 2a probe returned `RC == 0`), re-dispatch on
that branch; otherwise stop and report.

### Phase 2c — Consume

Read `$WORK/re-summary.txt` (the only RE text in this context). From it you have:
framework, HTTP stack, host counts, endpoint count, key-flow names, secrets
count, and the RE method. Read `$WORK/re-digest.md` or `$WORK/payloads.json`
**on demand** when a later phase needs detail. Keep the summary in context for
Phases 3–8.

## Phase 3: Store Analysis

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/scripts/scrape-play-store.py "$PKG" > "$WORK/play.json"
```
Read `play.json` for rating, rating_count, installs, category, developer, updated.
Use the `title` to check iOS:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/scripts/check-appstore.py "<title>" > "$WORK/appstore.json"
```
If Play scrape returned mostly nulls (page layout changed), fall back to a web
search for the app's metrics and note the source. App Store absence is fine —
continue with Google Play data only.

Download the screenshots for visual ground truth:
```bash
mkdir -p "$WORK/screenshots"
python3 - "$WORK/play.json" "$WORK/screenshots" <<'PY'
import json, sys, os, urllib.request
play, outdir = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]
urls = (json.load(open(play)).get("screenshot_urls") or [])
man = []
for i, u in enumerate(urls, 1):
    dest = os.path.join(outdir, f"{i:02d}.png")
    try:
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(u, dest); man.append({"order": i, "url": u, "path": dest})
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"WARN: screenshot {i} failed: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
json.dump(man, open(os.path.join(outdir, "manifest.json"), "w"), indent=2)
print(f"saved {len(man)} screenshots")
PY
```
If `screenshot_urls` is null/empty (layout change), note it and rely on
`design-tokens.json` + a web image search for visual reference.

## Phase 4: Stack Recommendation

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/references/stack-recommendation-guide.md`.
Using the RE results + store data, present 2-3 stack options as a table and ask
the user to choose. **Wait for the user's choice before Phase 5.** Lock it.

## Phase 5: Effort & Cost Estimation

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/references/effort-estimation-guide.md`
and `infra-cost-guide.md`. Build:
- read `$WORK/payloads.json`; the endpoint count and the payload complexity of
  the key flows size the backend work,
- the feature list + backend surface → AI-Sprint effort table (min-max total,
  uncertainty band; widen the band when RE Method is `limited:`),
- the MVP/Growth/Scale monthly infra cost table.
Base both on the **user-selected stack** from Phase 4.

## Phase 6: Market Viability Report

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/references/report-template.md`.
Fill every section from the data gathered. For market analysis (competitors,
market size), use web search as needed. Produce a GO / CONDITIONAL GO / NO GO
verdict tying effort + cost against market opportunity.
Include a **Backend API Surface** section: summarize the Tier-1 inventory from
`$WORK/re-digest.md` and the key-flow payloads from `$WORK/payloads.json` (host
list, endpoint count, auth model, and the auth/payment/core request+response
shapes). If RE Method was `limited:`, say so and note the reduced confidence.
Also fill the **Design System** section from `$WORK/design-tokens.json` and
`$WORK/design-digest.md` per `report-template.md`. For Unity apps, also fill
the **Game Assets** section from `$WORK/unity-digest.md` per `report-template.md`.

Write the report:
```
$WORK/clone-report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
```
(Use the actual run date.) Show the user a concise summary + the verdict.

## Phase 7: Decision Gate

Ask: "Feasibility report saved to `$WORK/clone-report-<date>.md`. Proceed to
build the implementation plan? (This runs the deep **fidelity pass** — full
API payloads, in-app logic, navigation graph, and an inferred backend design —
and produces a second report.)"
- **Yes** → run Phase 8: the fidelity pass, then assemble the build spec and
  hand off to `superpowers:writing-plans`.
- **No** → stop; the feasibility report stands on its own. The fidelity pass
  (and its token cost) is never incurred.

## Phase 8: Fidelity Pass + Build Spec

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/references/fidelity-pass-guide.md`.

### Phase 8a — Fidelity subagent (deep extraction)

Dispatch one subagent (Agent tool, `general-purpose`). It reuses what Phase 2
already decompiled to `$WORK/output` — **no re-download, no re-decompile**. Pass
it `$PKG`, `$WORK`, the clone-app scripts dir `$CA`
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/scripts/`), and the paths to
`fidelity-pass-guide.md`, `logic-capture-guide.md`, `backend-recon-guide.md`.
Its instructions:

1. **Full Tier-2 payloads.** Extend `$WORK/payloads.json` so every first-party
   endpoint carries request/response/headers (third-party stays Tier-1).
2. **In-app logic.** Run
   `python3 "$CA/extract-logic.py" "$WORK/output" --out "$WORK/logic-signals.json"`,
   then write `$WORK/logic-digest.md` per `logic-capture-guide.md`.
3. **Navigation graph.** Run
   `python3 "$CA/extract-nav-graph.py" "$WORK/output" --out "$WORK/nav-graph.json"`.
4. **Backend recon.** Write `$WORK/backend-recon.md` per `backend-recon-guide.md`.
5. **Unity (if RE Method indicated Unity).** Deepen `$WORK/unity-digest.md` with
   game mechanics / formulas per `unity-re-guide.md`.
6. **Return** a short fidelity summary + the artifact paths — never raw sources.

If the subagent fails, retry once; if it still fails, continue with whatever
artifacts exist and note the gap in the fidelity report.

### Phase 8b — Fidelity report

Write `$WORK/fidelity-report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (actual run date): summarize the
logic digest, navigation graph, full API surface, and backend recon, each with
its confidence. This is a standalone report alongside the feasibility one.

### Phase 8c — Build spec

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/clone-app/references/clone-build-spec-template.md`.
Assemble `$WORK/clone-build-spec.md`, filling every section from the artifacts:
- §2 from `$WORK/design-tokens.json` (+ `design-digest.md`),
- §3 one entry per screen, each paired with `$WORK/screenshots/NN.png`, plus its
  logic from `$WORK/logic-digest.md`,
- §3b user-flow diagrams from `$WORK/logic-digest.md`,
- §4 from `$WORK/nav-graph.json`,
- §5 from `$WORK/payloads.json` (full Tier-2), §5b + §6 from `$WORK/backend-recon.md`,
- §7 asset inventory from `$WORK/output` (or `$WORK/game-assets/` for Unity),
- §8 acceptance criteria per screen + flow,
- §10 absolute paths to every `$WORK/` artifact.
Use the **Game variant** sections when RE Method indicated Unity.

Then invoke `superpowers:writing-plans`, passing `$WORK/clone-build-spec.md` as
the spec and citing BOTH `$WORK/clone-report-<date>.md` and
`$WORK/fidelity-report-<date>.md` as reference. The build spec + `$WORK/` is the
standalone input — a fresh session with it can build an exact / near-exact clone.

## Error Handling Summary

|---|---|
| Package not in URL | ask user for package name |
| Download fails 3× | ask for local APK path |
| RE skill + scripts both missing | show resolver error, stop |
| RE subagent fails | retry once, then fall back to direct-scripts branch; else stop |
| Subagent returned no digest files | re-dispatch once; if still missing, stop and report |
| Flutter/RN/Cordova/Xamarin | warn, continue with limited RE |
| App Store not found | continue Google Play only |
| Play scrape returns nulls | web-search fallback, note source |
| Heavy obfuscation | add uncertainty band, note in report |
| writing-plans unavailable | write the plan as Markdown manually |
| Unity build detected | run IL2CPP/Mono branch + AssetRipper |
| Unity tool missing | continue, partial digest, RE Method `limited: unity-no-tools` |
| No screenshots on Play | note it, rely on design-tokens + web image search |
| Phase 7 = No | stop after feasibility report; skip the fidelity pass |
| Fidelity subagent fails | retry once, then continue with partial artifacts and note the gap |
| extract-logic/nav-graph finds nothing (Flutter/RN) | note low confidence, lean on screenshots + API contract |
